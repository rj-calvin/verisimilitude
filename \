\chapter{Dogma Regarding the Interpretation of Language}

Languages without interpretation are called \emph{alien languages}.

\rule

Languages without a unique interpretation are called \emph{contingent
languages}.

There are three kinds of contingent languages: secret languages, natural
languages, and strategic languages.

Secret languages are the languages spoken by the mind to itself.

Natural languages are formed using the mechanism of universal translation that
all sentient machines use to acquire language.

A \emph{decision} is an indivisible transformation of a medium.

All decisions are made by applying the mechanism of universal translation to
secret languages.

Natural language that can be interpreted as a decision is called strategic
language.

The decisions that are represented by strategic language are called
\emph{strategic decisions}.

All strategic languages are formed from natural languages using the principle
of universal empathy.

When the interpretation of contingent language is contingent on strategic
language, the interpretation is referred to as dogma.

All translations of secret languages are \emph{alien}.

\rule

Languages with a unique interpretation are called formal languages.

All formal languages can be built from secret languages using the calculus of
constructions.

Like contingent languages, there are three kinds of formal languages:
noncomputable language, computable language, and unsafe language.

Noncomputable language is a formal language that can be interpreted as
strategic language.

Computable language is a formal language that can be used to represent
transformations of a medium.

Computable language that can be interpreted as a decision is called unsafe
language.

The decisions that are represented by unsafe language are called \emph{unsafe
decisions}.

All unsafe decisions are strategic decisions.
